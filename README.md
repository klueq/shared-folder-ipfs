# What is this?
Think about a shared folder on an FTP server where many users can add files. In this folder there is also a special `rules` script that enforces certain rules about what files can be added, who can add them and so on. This shared folder has some disadvantages: there is an admin who is above the rules and all the files are stored in one place. The idea of this project is to use [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) to implement this shared folder pattern without the disadvantages: there won't be an admin and there won't be a single place where the files are stored.
